<h1>Phase&nbsp;transitions</h1>
<p>The thermodynamic state of a system can be described by a general free energy <span class="math">\(F=F(K)\)</span>, which depends on a set <span class="math">\(K\)</span> of intensive and extensive variables, such as, the temperature, volume and particle number <span class="math">\(T,V,N\)</span>, the magnetization <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, the applied external magnetic field <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, or more generally, the set of parameters appearing in the microscopic hamiltonian: characteristic lengths of the interaction, magnetic exchange energies, spin-orbit coupling, etc. The free energy is a continuous <em>convex up</em> (concave) function of its arguments, as can be derived from its definition in statistical&nbsp;mechanics,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
F = - T \ln Z
$$</div>
<p>
(we take <span class="math">\(k_\mathrm{B}=1\)</span>, as usual) where the canonical partition function <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is essentially a sum of&nbsp;exponentials.</p>
<p>A <em>thermodynamic phase</em> is the region in parameter space <span class="math">\(K\)</span> (the thermodynamic phase space) where <span class="math">\(f=F/V = f(K)\)</span>, in the thermodynamic limit, remains analytic (<span class="math">\(V, N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>), or in other terms, phases are homogeneous systems with stable <em>qualitative</em> physical properties. However, varying a parameter (for instance the temperature, or the external magnetic field), may induce a dramatic change in the state of the system. These changes signal the existence of a <em>phase transition</em> at a <em>critical value</em> of the control parameter. Common examples of phase transitions are the solid-liquid and para-ferromagnetic transition: lowering the temperature, the control parameter, one passes from a isotropic liquid to a cristalline solid, or from a disordered isotropic state (paramagnetic) to an ordered state (ferromagnetic) of lower&nbsp;symmetry.</p>
<p>One may distinguish two types of transitions between different thermodynamic phases: phase transitions associated with a release or absorption of latent heat (first order in the Ehrenfest classification) characterized by the appearance of a discontinuity in the thermodynamic quantities; and continuous phase transitions (second order in the Ehrenfest classification; however, this terminology is not appropriated because, for instance, the heat capacity can diverge at the transition). Phase diagrams represent the different phases in the parameter space: the plots below are typical of argon, which behaves as other classical fluids, and helium (He), which undergoes a superfluid phase transition at around <span class="math">\(4\,\mathrm{K}\)</span> (the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>&nbsp;line). </p>
<blockquote>

<img src="/images/PS-PT_he.svg" alt="He phase diagram" style="height: 200px;"/></p>
<p>Typical phase diagram in the pressure-temperature space of a classical fluid (Ar) and of helium. First order transitions are double lines, second order ones simple lines. The transition line between gas and liquid phases ends at the critical point (<span class="caps">PC</span>); the three phases (solid-liquid-gas) join at the triple point. In the case of helium, the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> line, starts and ends at points in which a second order phase transition transforms into a first order one. The superfluid phase is quantum; note that the liquid state remains up to zero temperature for a range of&nbsp;pressures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figures below show experimental data of the gas-liquid, a first order transition, and the second order, continuous, transition between disordered and ordered magnetic&nbsp;states.</p>
<blockquote>

The fitting solid line is a cubic interpolating polynomial, which leads to the power law for the density as a function of the temperature,  <span class="math">\((\rho - \rho_g)/\rho_g \sim (T-T_c)^\beta\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(\beta = 1/3\)</span>, near the transition temperature <span class="math">\(T_c\)</span>. More accurate experimental results show that <span class="math">\(\beta\approx 0.354\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A distinctive property of (continuous) phase transitions is their <em>universal</em> behavior. Indeed, the thermodynamic quantities at the critical control parameter, follow power laws with <em>universal exponents</em>, exponents that do no depend on the details of the material or on the specific form of the microscopic interaction forces. This is the case, as discovered by Widom, of the equation of state of a magnetic material <span class="math">\(H=H(M,T)\)</span> relating the magnetic field <span class="math">\(H\)</span> to the magnetization <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and the temperature <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, which, around the transition, can be written in the similarity&nbsp;form,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
H = M^\delta g(t/M^\beta)\,, \quad t = |T-T_c|/T_c\,,
$$</div>
<p>
thus, the two variable function <span class="math">\(H(M,T)\)</span> collapses into a &#8220;universal&#8221; single variable function characterized be the exponents <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>, which controls the temperature dependence of the magnetization, and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, which gives the behavior of the magnetization as a function of the applied field at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>. Different ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Ni, Co,&#8230;), as experimentally verified, satisfy this law with the <em>same</em> function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> (see the figure&nbsp;below).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the paramagnetic state the macroscopic magnetization <span class="math">\(\bm M\)</span> vanishes. The magnetization is defined as the thermodynamic average of the microscopic magnetic moments <span class="math">\(\bm \mu\)</span> per volume&nbsp;unit,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\bm M = \frac{1}{V} \sum_x \braket{\bm \mu_x}\,,
$$</div>
<p>
for a homogeneous state, where the magnetic moment is related to the spin by <span class="math">\(\bm \mu = -g\mu_B \bm S\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\mu_B\)</span> is the Bohr magneton and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> the g-factor). In the ferromagnetic state, the magnetization acquires a nonzero value together with a definite direction, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Although the behavior of the magnetization at low temperature is rather complex, because of the appearance of quantum effects, near the transition the magnetic properties are the same for a variety of ferromagnetic materials, and characterized by a unique exponent <span class="math">\(\beta \approx 0.3\)</span>. However, some other materials, such us the gadolinium-zinc, also follows a power law, but with a different exponent,  <span class="math">\(\beta = 1/2\)</span>, which corresponds to the &#8220;mean field&#8221; value, as we shall see (figure&nbsp;below).</p>
<blockquote>

The magnetic susceptibility is also displayed for <span class="math">\(T&gt;T_c \approx 270\,\mathrm{K}\)</span>, showing that the Curie law <span class="math">\(\chi \sim (T-T_c)^{-1}\)</span> is satisfied in the paramagnetic state, but with a divergence at <span class="math">\(T_c\)</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One important feature of the continuous phase transition is the presence of large fluctuations, leading to the divergence of the heat capacity (related to the fluctuation of the energy) and the susceptibility (related to the response to an applied external force). The figure above shows that the magnetic susceptibility near the transition, diverges following a power&nbsp;law,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\chi = \left. \frac{\D M}{\D H} \right|_{H=0} \approx (T-T_c)^\gamma\,,
$$</div>
<p>
with exponent <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> (equal to <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> in the mean field&nbsp;case).</p>
<h2>Landau theory of phase&nbsp;transitions</h2>
<p>A defining property of the continuous phase transition is the difference in the symmetry of the states above and below the critical control parameter. This difference implies an essential discontinuity in the thermodynamic properties of the two phases: the symmetry exists or not. To describe the symmetry of the phases Landau introduced a thermodynamic variable, the <em>order parameter</em> <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, which vanishes above the transition and, below the transition, it is nonzero. The mathematical nature of the order parameter depends on the physical properties of the&nbsp;system:</p>
<ul>
<li>is a scalar <span class="math">\(\phi = (p_A - p_b)/(p_A + p_B))\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(p_A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_B\)</span> are, in an alloy <span class="math">\(AB\)</span>, the probabilities to find the respective atom in a given site of the crystal lattice, in the transition between two cristalline&nbsp;structures,</li>
<li>is a vector <span class="math">\(\bm M\)</span>, the magnetization, in the magnetic&nbsp;transition,</li>
<li>is a complex function <span class="math">\(\Psi\)</span>, related to the quantum wave function <span class="math">\(\ket{\Psi}\)</span>, in the case of the helium fluid-superfluid&nbsp;transition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thermodynamics of the phase transition is then described by an effective free energy, the landau function, which is a functional of the order&nbsp;parameter:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
F=F[\phi]\,.
$$</div>
<p>
Although is usual to denote by <span class="math">\(F\)</span> the landau function, it should not be confused with the free energy (helmholtz or gibbs), which is a function of the thermodynamic state. The minima of the landau free energy correspond to the phases of the system: transitions occur at specific values of the control parameter for which the order parameter changes to a nonzero&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>The form of the landau free energy is essentially fixed by the symmetries and the analyticity of the phases. By definition of the order parameter, which vanishes in the disordered phase, analyticity implies that near the transition <span class="math">\(F\)</span> can be expanded in powers of the order&nbsp;parameter,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
F(\phi) = F_0 + a \phi^2 + c \phi^3 + b \phi^4 +\ldots
$$</div>
<p>
where the phenomenological constants <span class="math">\(a,c, b\)</span> may be functions of the temperature. If the system possesses a <span class="math">\(\phi \rightarrow -\phi\)</span> symmetry, the coefficient of the odd powers <span class="math">\(c,\ldots\)</span>, vanish, as it is the case for the transition between para and ferro states in a magnetic material. The linear term must be identically zero if the two phases have different symmetries, as we are supposing for the continuous phase transitions: the equilibrium should depend on the different behavior of the order parameter on the two sides of the transition. The third order term is characteristic of the isotropic liquid to the solid transition, and is associated with a discontinuity of the order parameter at the transition. In the following we are primarily interested in the second-order like transitions, and then on a landau function expanded in even powers of <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Magnetic&nbsp;transition</h3>
<p>We take as a relevant example, a magnetic system which undergoes a paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition. The natural order parameter is the magnetization <span class="math">\(\bm M\)</span>. As a consequence of the symmetry, in the ordered state, the directions up or down of the magnetization should be equivalent, implying that <span class="math">\(F[\bm M]\)</span> must be a pair function; in addition, we take into account the possible non uniformity of the magnetization, which therefore becomes a field <span class="math">\(\bm M(\bm x)\)</span>, 
</p>
<div class="math">$$
F[M]=\int \Di{\bm x} \left[\frac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \bm M)^2 + f(M) - \bm H \cdot \bm M \right] \,,\quad f(M) = a M^2 + b M^4
$$</div>
<p>
where now <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a functional the magnetization field and the applied external field <span class="math">\(\bm H\)</span>. The parameter <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> is related to the exchange energy. In the disordered state <span class="math">\(\bm M =0\)</span> and in the ordered state <span class="math">\(\bm M = M \bm n\)</span>. At low temperature the magnetization selects a specific direction <span class="math">\(\bm n\)</span> (a vector of unit length), which, in the presence of a magnetic field, follows its direction. The parameters <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b&gt;0\)</span> are phenomenological and may depend on the temperature (<span class="math">\(b\)</span> is positive to ensure thermodynamic stability of the two phases). We absorbed the factor <span class="math">\(\mu_0\)</span> normally appearing in the last term, in the definition of <span class="math">\(\bm H\)</span> and take <span class="math">\(g\mu_B\)</span> as the unit of magnetic moment, such that <span class="math">\(\bm H\)</span> has the dimensions of an energy, and <span class="math">\(\bm M\)</span> has the dimensions of the inverse of&nbsp;volume.</p>
<p>We may see the magnetization as a coarse grained quantity build from the microscopic spins <span class="math">\(\bm S_i\)</span> associated to the site <span class="math">\(i\)</span> of a crystal&nbsp;lattice
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\bm M(\bm x) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}(\mathrm{B})}\sum_{i \in \mathrm{B}(\bm x)} \bm S_i
$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(\mathrm{B}(\bm x)\)</span> is a set of sites around the position <span class="math">\(\bm x \in V\)</span> (the total system&#8217;s volume <span class="math">\(V\)</span>). Defined in this way <span class="math">\(\bm M(\bm x)\)</span> is a smooth function of the position, provided the number of sites in the ball <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is already macroscopic. The landau functional arises, in this case, as a coarse-grained averaging of the microscopic&nbsp;hamiltonian:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
Z(T,V) = \mathrm{Tr}\exp\big(- H[\bm S_i]/T \big)  = \int D[\bm M(\bm x)] \exp\big( - F[\bm M(\bm x)]/T  \big)\,,
$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(F[\bm M]\)</span> is the landau functional given above, and the integration is a <em>functional integral</em> over the magnetization&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>For a homogeneous system with <span class="math">\(\bm H =0\)</span>, the possible values of the magnetization depend on the minima of the function <span class="math">\(f=f(M)\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
M=0 \,, \quad \text{if } a(T) &gt;0\,,
$$</div>
<p>
or,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
M = \pm [-a(T)/2b]^{1/2}\,,\quad \text{if } a(T) &lt; 0\,.
$$</div>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/PS-fM.png" alt="magnetic transition" style="height: 200px;"/></p>
<p>Landau function for the paramagnetic state <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span> and the ferromagnetic state <span class="math">\(a&lt;0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the transition temperature <span class="math">\(T_c\)</span> corresponds to the zero of the function <span class="math">\(a(T)\)</span>; the analyticity of <span class="math">\(F\)</span> means that we can expand it in a&nbsp;series,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
a(T)=A \, (T-T_c) + O(|T-T_c|^2)  ,\;\Rightarrow\; a&lt;0,\;\text{for } T&lt;T_c
$$</div>
<p>
such that <span class="math">\(a(T_c)=0\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(A\)</span> a constant. Replacing this expression into the equilibrium magnetization, we&nbsp;obtain
</p>
<div class="math">$$
M \sim |T-T_c|^\beta,\quad \beta = 1/2\,,
$$</div>
<p>
with the same exponent as the one obtained in mean field approximation of the ising&nbsp;model.</p>
<p>The homogeneous state is not structurally stable near the transition: spatial fluctuations become dominant in the limit <span class="math">\(T\rightarrow T_c\)</span>. The physical manifestation of that is the divergence of the response coefficients, like the susceptibility (a scalar in an isotropic&nbsp;medium):
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
M(\bm x) &amp;= -\frac{\delta F}{\delta H(\bm x)},\\ 
\chi(|\bm x - \bm x'|) &amp;= \frac{\delta M(\bm x)}{\delta  H(\bm x')} = -\frac{\delta^2 F}{\delta H(\bm x) \delta H(\bm x')},
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p>
(where <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H\)</span> are two vector components in the same direction, the susceptibility do not depend on the direction) computed at equilibrium, where the system is statistically translation&nbsp;invariant.</p>
<p>Near thermodynamic equilibrium a universal relation exists between the linear response susceptibility <span class="math">\(\chi\)</span> and the correlation function <span class="math">\(C\)</span>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
C(|\bm x-\bm x'|) = \langle M(\bm x) M(\bm x') \rangle - \langle M(\bm x)\rangle^2  \,,
$$</div>
<p>
of the corresponding physical quantity. Indeed, using the partition function in the&nbsp;form,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
Z(T, H)=\int D[\bm M]\, \E^{-F[\bm M]/ T - \int \D \bm x\, \bm H \cdot \bm M/T}
$$</div>
<p>
one can compute the second functional derivatives with respect to any vector&nbsp;coordinate,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\chi=\frac{\delta F}{\delta H \delta H'}= T \left[ \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\delta^2 Z}{\delta H \delta H'} - \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta H} \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\delta Z}{\delta H'} \right]  = \frac{1}{T} \left[\braket{MM'}-\braket{M} \braket{M'} \right]
$$</div>
<p>
we obtain, at <span class="math">\(H=0\)</span>, the <em>fluctuation-dissipation</em>&nbsp;theorem
</p>
<div class="math">$$
C(|\bm x - \bm x'|) = T \chi(|\bm x - \bm x'|)\,.
$$</div>
<p>In the equilibrium state the magnetization has a constant value <span class="math">\(M = \bar{m}\)</span>, different in each phase, <span class="math">\(\bar{m}=0\)</span> (paramagnetic state), and <span class="math">\(\bar{m}=[A(T_c-T)/2b]^{1/2}\)</span> (ferromagnetic state); around this equilibrium state, the order parameter&nbsp;fluctuates,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\bm M(\bm x) = [\bar{m} + \phi_0(\bm x) ] \bm n + \bm \phi_\perp(\bm x)
$$</div>
<p>
where we defined the fluctuation field <span class="math">\(\bm \phi\)</span>, which is decomposed into a longitudinal direction <span class="math">\(\hat{\bm n}\)</span> (the direction of the applied field) of amplitude <span class="math">\(\phi_0\)</span>, and a transverse one <span class="math">\(\bm \phi_\perp\)</span>.</p>
<p>Substituting this expansion into the free energy one gets <span class="math">\(F=F[\bar{m}] + F[\phi_0] + F[\bm\phi_\perp]\)</span>,
</p>
<div class="math">$$
F[\phi_0] = \int \D \bm x \, [ \tfrac{\kappa}{2} (\nabla \phi_0 )^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} (2a+12b \bar{m}^2) \phi_0^2  ]

<p>
In analogy with the harmonic oscillator, this term is a restoring force; and it is zero for the transverse fluctuations in the ordered state: the correlation length goes to infinity. Fluctuations in the transverse direction give rise to oscillations of the magnetization around its mean direction, magnetization waves (Goldstone modes of low energy, arising from the breaking of a continuous symmetry, rotation&nbsp;here).</p>

<p>The structure function (in the mean field theory) in the ferromagnetic state. The longitudinal fluctuations <span class="math">\(S_l\)</span> have a lorentzian spectrum; the transverse fluctuations diverge at large wavelengths. At the critical temperature both spectra diverge as <span class="math">\(\sim 1/q^2\)</span> for <span class="math">\(q \rightarrow 0\)</span>.</p>

<p>At the critical temperature both susceptibilities diverge <span class="math">\(\chi_\alpha \sim 1/q^2\)</span>, or in real space <span class="math">\(\chi_\alpha(r) \sim 1/r\)</span> <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>, but the perpendicular one is divergent in the whole ordered phase. The longitudinal susceptibility represents the response of the magnitude of the order parameter, while the perpendicular one describes the response to a change in direction of the magnetization: in the ordered phase changing the direction of all spins (rotating the perpendicular vector around the longitudinal one), do not cost much energy: the perpendicular mode is called the soft mode, and extending it to the frequency domain (time dependent fluctuations) shows the presence of &#8220;spin&#8221; waves. This phenomenon is general to the breaking of a continuous symmetry&nbsp;(rotation).</p>
