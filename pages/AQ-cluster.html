<h1>Cluster state and quantum&nbsp;computation</h1>
<p>The most basic model of quantum computation is the <em>circuit</em>, in which an initial state, usually a product state <span class="math">\(\ket{0}^N\)</span> of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> qubits, is acted upon by a sequence of universal one and two qubits gates; for instance the pauli <span class="math">\(\bm \sigma = (X,Y,Z)\)</span>, hadamard <span class="math">\(\mathsf{H}\)</span>, the phase <span class="math">\(\mathsf{S}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\pi/4\)</span> phase <span class="math">\(\mathsf{T}\)</span> one qubit gates, complemented with the two qubits <span class="math">\(\mathsf{CNOT}\)</span> gate. Because of its universality the circuit model is also useful as a representation of other quantum computation models. Another important class is the <em>topological</em> model, whose first formulation is based on the <a href="/pages/AQ-toric.html">toric code</a> of Kitaev. In this case the computational resource is an entangled quantum state, the ground state of a many-body hamiltonian. Excitations of the toric code ground state are anyons, topological &#8220;particles&#8221; that take a phase when exchanged (not necessarily 0, as for bosons, or <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>, as for fermions). Braiding these quasiparticles is thus used to implement logical gates. A third important quantum computational model is the cellular <em>automaton</em>. The idea is to apply a local unitary to a set of qubits (arranged in a line or a lattice) to an initial state, in order to, by discrete time iteration, update the state of the systems to eventually get a useful entangled state. The unitary generally implements a simple rule, in analogy with the classical cellular automata, and is applied in parallel; its homogeneity ensures translational invariance. The three models of quantum computation, circuit, topological, and automaton, are equivalently universal, in the sense that they can implement any <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-body unitary&nbsp;operator.</p>
<p>A variant of the topological quantum model of computation is the one based on teleportation; it is called <em>measurement based</em> quantum computation. Let us start with an&nbsp;example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/AQ-c_gtz.svg" alt="teleportation of Z" style="height: 44px;"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial state is the product <span class="math">\(\ket{t_0} = \ket{\psi}\otimes\ket{0} = a\ket{00} + b \ket{10}\)</span>, after the <span class="math">\(\mathsf{CNOT}\)</span> we get the <em>entangled</em>&nbsp;state
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{t_1} = a \ket{00} + b \ket{11},$$</div>
<p>
which is our computational resource. To exploit this resource we <em>measure</em> the first qubit in the base <span class="math">\(\ket{\pm}\)</span> of the <span class="math">\(X\)</span> operator. Note that <span class="math">\(\ket{t_1}\)</span> writes <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>,
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{t_1} = P_+ \ket{t_1} + P_- \ket{t_1} = \frac{\ket{+}}{\sqrt{2}}\big(a\ket{0} + b \ket{1}\big) + \frac{\ket{+}}{\sqrt{2}}\big(a\ket{0} - b \ket{1}\big)$$</div>
<p>
where we used the projectors <span class="math">\(P_\pm  = \ket{\pm}\bra{\pm}\)</span>, the pre-measurement&nbsp;state:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\frac{\ket{+}}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\psi} + \frac{\ket{-}}{\sqrt{2}} Z\ket{\psi}.$$</div>
<p>
The final state of the second qubit, after the measurement, is&nbsp;then
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{\mathrm{out}} = Z^b \ket{\psi}$$</div>
<p>
according to the result <span class="math">\(b\)</span> of the first qubit measurement. As a result the circuit teleports the <span class="math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> state, possibly modified by the gate <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>. Had we measured the first qubit in other basis, we could obtain other one qubit gate applied to the teleported state. Indeed, the slightly modified&nbsp;circuit</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/AQ-c_gtr.svg" alt="teleportation of R" style="height: 44px;"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>in which we measure the first qubit in the base of the operator <span class="math">\(O = \bm{n} \cdot \bm \sigma\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\bm n = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta,0)\)</span>, leads to the output state <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{\mathrm{out}} = \E^{-\I \theta Z/2} Z^b \ket{\mathrm{in}}.$$</div>
<p>
<em>Hint</em>. Use the&nbsp;eigenvectors
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{\theta_\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
  \E^{-\I\theta/2} \\ \pm\E^{\I\theta/2}
\end{pmatrix}$$</div>
<p>
of the <span class="math">\(O\)</span> and the corresponding projectors to write the state just before the measure, as in the previous&nbsp;calculation.</p>
<p>We observe that an appropriated measurement of on a single qubit on a previously prepared entangled state, is a computational resource that can be used to effectively apply a logical gate to an initial state; in the case of the last circuit we transformed the initial arbitrary state <span class="math">\(\ket{\mathrm{in}}\)</span>, into a rotated output one. As a result of the measurement, the entanglement in the system decreases, which is consistent with the notion of entanglement as a resource. In addition, too much entanglement, as for instance a thermal state (maximally entangled), would not be useful because the sequence of measurements cannot be distinguished from a random processes, which in fact can be efficiently implemented by a classical computer. Therefore, we need a <em>useful</em> entangled state: the cluster state satisfies these requirements, one qubits measurements can implement in it one qubit gates and the <span class="math">\(\mathsf{CNOT}\)</span> gate, leading to universal&nbsp;computing.</p>
<h2>Cluster state on a&nbsp;graph</h2>
<p>A graph <span class="math">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is a set of <span class="math">\(|V|\)</span> vertices <span class="math">\(x \in V\)</span> linked by edges <span class="math">\(E = \{(x,y) \mid x, y \in V\}\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/AQ-VE.svg" alt="graph VE" style="height: 120px;"/>
<img src="/images/AQ-VEcz.svg" alt="graph VE CZ" style="height: 120px;"/></p>
<p>(left) A graph <span class="math">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> of <span class="math">\(|V| = 5\)</span> qubits, initially in the state <span class="math">\(\ket{+}\)</span>; (right) a cluster state obtained by application of the gate <span class="math">\(\mathsf{CZ}\)</span> to each edge in <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span> of the figure corresponds to the set of vertices <span class="math">\(V=\{0,1,2,3,4\}\)</span> and the set of edges <span class="math">\(E = \{(0,1),(0,4),(1,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)\}\)</span>. To construct the <em>cluster</em> state we associate to each node <span class="math">\(x \in V\)</span> a quantum state <span class="math">\(\ket{+}\)</span> (the 1 eigenvalue eigenvector of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>), then we apply the controlled phase&nbsp;gate
</p>
<div class="math">$$\mathsf{CZ}(x,y) = \frac{1+Z_x}{2} \otimes 1_y + \frac{1-Z_x}{2} \otimes Z_y = \mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,-1),$$</div>
<p>
which change the sign of the <span class="math">\(\ket{11}\)</span> amplitude, to each edge <span class="math">\((x,y) \in E\)</span>;&nbsp;therefore,
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\label{e:C}
  \ket{C} = \prod_{(x,y)\in E} \mathsf{CZ}(x,y) \ket{+}^N
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(N = |V|\)</span> is the number of qubits, and to simplify the notation we write the kronecker product as a product of&nbsp;kets. </p>
<p>The hilbert space of the graph <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}(G)\)</span> is spanned by the&nbsp;vectors
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{s} = \ket{s_0} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{s_{N-1}} = \ket{s_0\ldots s_{N-1}} \in \mathcal{H}(G), \; s_x=\{0,1\}, \; x = 0,\ldots,N-1.$$</div>
<p>
In this basis the action of the controlled phase gate&nbsp;is
</p>
<div class="math">$$\mathsf{CZ}(x,y) \ket{\ldots s_x \ldots s_y \ldots} = (-1)^{s_x s_y}\ket{\ldots s_x \ldots s_y \ldots}.$$</div>
<p>
The string <span class="math">\(\{s_0\ldots s_{N-!}\}\)</span> is the binary representation of the integer <span class="math">\(s \in [0, 2^N -1]\)</span> (the equivalent of the classical configuration of a set of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> ising&nbsp;spins).</p>
<h3>Example: two and three&nbsp;qubits</h3>
<p>The simplest cluster state is the one formed by two&nbsp;qubits:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C_2} = \mathsf{CZ}(0,1) \ket{++} = \frac{1}{2} \big( \ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10} - \ket{11}\big) = \mathsf{H} \otimes 1_2 \ket{\Phi_+}$$</div>
<p>
where the last equality shows that the <span class="math">\(\ket{C_2}\)</span> state is equivalent to a bell state up to one qubit operations (here the hadamard gate <span class="math">\(\mathsf{H}\)</span>). It is straightforward to show that the schmidt decomposition of <span class="math">\(\ket{C_2}\)</span> leads to two <span class="math">\(p_n = 1/2\)</span> (<span class="math">\(n=1,2\)</span>) eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, which implies that the von Neumann entropy is&nbsp;maximal:
</p>
<div class="math">$$S_1[C_2] = -\sum_{n=\{1,2\}} p_n \log p_n = 1.$$</div>
<p>The case of three qubits can be represented by the&nbsp;circuit</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/AQ-C3.svg" alt="C3" style="height: 60px;"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which gives <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C_3} = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}} \sum_{s_0, s_1, s_2} (-1)^{s_0 s_1 + s_0 s_2 + s_1 s_2} \ket{s_0 s_1 s_2},$$</div>
<p>
or&nbsp;explicitly
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C_3} = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}} \big( \ket{000} + \ket{001} + \ket{010} - \ket{011} + \ket{100} - \ket{101} - \ket{110} - \ket{111} \big).$$</div>
<p>
Note that in the sum, the exponent is computed using operations in the finite field <span class="math">\(\mathrm{GF}(2)\)</span>, addition and multiplication modulo&nbsp;2.</p>
<h3>Hamiltonian and&nbsp;stabilizers</h3>
<p>The <a href="/pages/AQ-error.html">stabilizer</a> of a state <span class="math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> is a subgroup <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> of the pauli group <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> generated by a set of mutually commuting operators <span class="math">\(\{g_0, g_1, \ldots\}\)</span> (essentially products of pauli matrices) satisfying <span class="math">\(g_n \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}\)</span>; the particular states <span class="math">\(\ket{i_L}\)</span>  satisfying this equation for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are <em>logical</em> states. Whence, the quantum state <span class="math">\(\ket{i_L}\)</span> is a common eigenvector of the stabilizers with eigenvalue 1 (the subgroup <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> do not contain the matrix <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>). We show now that the stabilizer formalism reveals the rich structure of the cluster state <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We reconsider the construction of the cluster state to identify step by step the relevant operators with eigenvalue 1. A graph of only one qubit in state <span class="math">\(\ket{+}\)</span> is easily related with the operator <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, which is its stabilizer. Adding a second qubit (also in the state <span class="math">\(\ket{+}\)</span>) and applying <span class="math">\(\mathsf{CZ}\)</span> we obtain the cluster state <span class="math">\(\ket{C_2}\)</span>, and we want to know how this state is modified by the (previous) stabilizer <span class="math">\(X\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$X_0 \mathsf{CZ}(0,1) \ket{++} = \mathsf{CZ}(0,1) X_0 Z_1 \ket{++}$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span> refer to the respective qubits number (vertices of the graph). Multiplying this expression by <span class="math">\(Z_1\)</span> (note that it commutes with everything), we&nbsp;get
</p>
<div class="math">$$X_0 Z_1 \mathsf{CZ}(0,1) \ket{++} = \mathsf{CZ}(0,1) \ket{++}$$</div>
<p>
which is just a stabilizer of <span class="math">\(\ket{C_2}\)</span>. Adding other neighbors, say <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, to <span class="math">\(0\)</span> will add to the stabilizer the corresponding <span class="math">\(Z_y\)</span>, therefore giving (by recurrence   <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>) the&nbsp;form
</p>
<div class="math">$$K_x = X_x \prod_{(x,y) \in N_x} Z_y$$</div>
<p>
of the stabilizer operator associated to vertex <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(N_x\)</span> is the set of neighbors of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math">\(|N_x|\)</span> is the degree of node <span class="math">\(x\)</span>). Note that the set of <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span> is commuting, and its cardinality coincides with the number of nodes, therefore the general cluster state of a graph <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span>&nbsp;satisfying
</p>
<div class="math">$$K_x \ket{C} = \ket{C}, \; \forall x,$$</div>
<p>
is unique. We can then write the stabilizer set&nbsp;explicitly
</p>
<div class="math">$$\mathcal{S} = \{K \mid [K,K_x] = 0, \forall x \in V\}, \; |\mathcal{S}| = N.$$</div>
<p>
We observe that when a stabilizer is applied to the &#8220;up&#8221;&nbsp;state
</p>
<div class="math">$$K_x \ket{0}^N = X_x \ket{0}^N = \ket{0\ldots 1 \ldots 0} \; \Rightarrow \; \braket{0|X|0}=0$$</div>
<p>
the new state is orthogonal to it. This leads us to the&nbsp;formula
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\label{e:CK}
\ket{C} = \frac{1}{2^{N/2}} \prod_{x \in V} \big(1 + K_x \big) \ket{0}^N
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
that express the cluster state as a superposition of <span class="math">\(2^N\)</span> (orthogonal) terms, spanning <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}(G)\)</span>. Note that <span class="math">\(K_x(1 + K_x) = 1 + K_x\)</span>, from which one deduce that <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span> is effectively eigenvector of <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span> with eigenvalue&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>Because <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S} = N\)</span> the dimension of the logical subspace is 0, and the cluster state do not code any logical qubit. We show below that a modification of the set of stabilizers may lead to a &#8220;degeneracy&#8221; of the cluster state which results in a nontrivial logical subspace: we can associate a <em>hamiltonian</em> to the graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and the corresponding cluster state <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we find that <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span> is the unique <em>ground state</em> of the&nbsp;hamiltonian
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\label{e:H}
  H_C = -J \sum_{x \in V} K_x = -J \sum_x \prod_{y \in N_x} X_x Z_y
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
formed by a sum over the stabilizers of <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$H_C \ket{C} = -NJ \ket{C},$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(-NJ\)</span> is the lowest possible energy. We remark that each term of <span class="math">\(H_C\)</span> is a local multibody interaction of neighboring qubits; <span class="math">\(J=1\)</span> is the energy scale, which can be taken as the energy unit. We may then, think the cluster state as a genuine phase of matter, since it is a ground state of a local hamiltonian. It is worth noting that, although the cluster state is unique, in the framework of a system defined by a hamiltonian, degeneracy is possible, depending on the boundary conditions: for instance on a regular lattice, where the boundary stabilizers are set to&nbsp;zero.</p>
<p>In summary, given a graph <span class="math">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> we define a hilbert space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}(G)\)</span> of dimension <span class="math">\(2^N\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(N=|V|\)</span>, and a hamiltonian <span class="math">\(H_C\)</span> which is a superposition of &#8220;cluster&#8221; operators <span class="math">\(K_x, x\in V\)</span>; these operators are the stabilizers of the cluster state <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span>, the ground state of <span class="math">\(H_C\)</span>.</p>
<h4>The one dimensional cluster&nbsp;hamiltonian</h4>
<p>In the special case of the one dimensional lattice with open boundary&nbsp;conditions
</p>
<div class="math">$$H_C^{(1)} = - \sum_{x=1}^{N-2} Z_{x-1} X_x Z_{x+1}$$</div>
<p>
the cluster state <span class="math">\(\ket{C^{(1)}}\)</span> is 4-fold degenerate, as can be seen by the fact that it is stabilized by <span class="math">\(N-2\)</span> operators <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span> (<span class="math">\(x=1,\ldots,N-2\)</span>), thus leaving free two qubits. Of course each <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span> is an integral of motion of <span class="math">\(H_C^{(1)}\)</span>. The <a href="/hexa2023.html">spin <span class="math">\(1/2\)</span> chain</a> with the cluster interaction, with open or periodic boundary conditions, is completely integrable, in the sense that it can be transformed into a system of free&nbsp;particles.</p>
<p>We also find two global&nbsp;symmetries
</p>
<div class="math">$$P_e = \prod_{x \in e} X_x, \; P_o = \prod_{x \in o} X_x, \quad e = \{0,2,4, \ldots\}, \; o = \{1,3,5, \ldots\}$$</div>
<p>
It is easy to verify that reversing the direction of every two spins leaves invariant the system, the two (parity symmetry) operators <span class="math">\(P_{e,o}\)</span> commute with the hamiltonian <span class="math">\(H_C^{(1)}\)</span>. The parity symmetry is associated with the <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> group whose generators are precisely <span class="math">\(P_{e,o}\)</span> (for example, the quantum ising model has a <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span>&nbsp;symmetry).</p>
<p>In addition we observe that the operators <span class="math">\(P_{e,o}\)</span> commute with <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span>, however <span class="math">\(\ket{C^{(1)}}\)</span> is not in their eigenstate space, we can therefore view these symmetries as the <em>logical</em> operators of the &#8220;cluster&#8221; code, spanned by the 4-fold degenerated ground state.&nbsp;Indeed,
</p>
<div class="math">$$[P_{e,o}, \mathsf{CZ}] = 0, \quad \mathsf{CZ} = \prod_{(x,y) \in E} \mathsf{CZ}(x,y)$$</div>
<p>
which implies that   <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>
</p>
<div class="math">$$\braket{C^{(1)} | P_n | C^{(1)}} = 0,  \; P_n \in \{P_e, P_o, P_eP_o\}$$</div>
<p>
which shows that the four states <span class="math">\(\{\ket{C^{(1)}}, P_n \ket{C^{(1)}}\}\)</span> are orthogonal and therefore span the ground state subspace of <span class="math">\(H^{(1)}_C\)</span>.</p>
<h2>Entanglement&nbsp;entropy</h2>
<p>To measure the entanglement of the cluster state <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:C}\)</span>, which is a pure state that can be associated to the time independent hamiltonian <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:H}\)</span>, we may use the von Neumann entropy: we partition the system into two sets of nodes <span class="math">\(x \in A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x \in B\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(A \cup B = V\)</span>, and&nbsp;compute
</p>
<div class="math">$$S_A = -\Tr \rho_A \log \rho_A, \; \rho_A = \Tr_B \ket{C} \bra{C}$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(\Tr_B\)</span> is the partial trace over the set <span class="math">\(B\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\log 2 = 1\)</span>). For an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium <span class="math">\(\rho_A\)</span> is the microcanonical density matrix, and the entropy is <em>extensive</em>, its value is proportional to the system&#8217;s size (<span class="math">\(|A| = N_A\)</span>, the number of sites in the partition <span class="math">\(A\)</span>). We do not expect for our system, which is in the ground state of <span class="math">\(H_C\)</span>, to satisfy this law. In fact, invoking the third law of thermodynamics (Nernst theorem), we would expect that the entropy of a <em>unique</em> state should be zero: the zero temperature state is dominated by the energy of the system, and the minimum energy configuration is unique. However, it is known that the ground state of some quantum systems can be disordered and therefore have a finite entropy. One example is the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We show now that the cluster state satisfy an <em>area law</em> for the entanglement entropy: it is proportional to the size of the boundary <span class="math">\(\partial A\)</span> between the two&nbsp;regions.</p>
<p>The product <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:CK}\)</span> can be transformed into a sum over the whole stabilizer&nbsp;group
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C} = \frac{1}{2^{|V|/2}} \prod_{x \in V} \big(1 + K_x\big) \ket{0}^{|V|} = \frac{1}{2^{|V|/2}} \sum_{K \in \mathcal{S}} K \ket{0}^{|V|},$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(|\mathcal{S}| = 2^{|V|}\)</span>. Each <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is a product of pauli&nbsp;matrices:
</p>
<div class="math">$$K = \sigma_0^{b_0} \sigma_1^{b_1} \ldots \sigma_{|V|-1}^{b_{|V|-1|}} = \sigma^b$$</div>
<p>
where we introduced the notation <span class="math">\(\sigma_x = 1_2, X, Y, Z\)</span> is one of the pauli matrices (including the identity) of vertex <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sigma = (\sigma_0, \ldots, \sigma_{|V|-1})\)</span> and  <span class="math">\(b = (b_0, \ldots, b_{|V|-1})\)</span> are vectors of pauli and  binary numbers, and the notation <span class="math">\(\sigma^b\)</span> stands for the kronecker product of paulis each of which to the power <span class="math">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Using this notation it is easy to write <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span> as a superposition of terms belonging to different subsets of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. We also introduce the notion of support of an&nbsp;operator:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\mathrm{supp} K = \{x \in V \mid \sigma_x^{b_x} \ne 1_2\}$$</div>
<p>
it is then the set of nodes over which <span class="math">\(K\)</span> acts on&nbsp;nontrivially.</p>
<p>We partition the graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span> into two domains <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. The boundary between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> cut the edges <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(x \in A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y \in B\)</span>. We distinguish among the stabilizers <span class="math">\(K\)</span> those <span class="math">\(K_{A_\circ}\)</span> whose support is entirely within <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, this set of nodes is called <span class="math">\(A_\circ\)</span> (the interior of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>), those <span class="math">\(K_{B_\circ}\)</span>,  equivalently, with support in <span class="math">\(B_\circ\)</span>, and finally <span class="math">\(K_{AB}\)</span> whose support belong to the interface between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.  We can split the domain <span class="math">\(V\)</span> into three nonoverlapping sets of nodes <span class="math">\(V = A_\circ \cup AB \cup B_\circ\)</span> according to the support of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>. The product <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:CK}\)</span> can then be written as a product of three nonoverlapping sets of nodes <span class="math">\(A_\circ, AB, B_\circ\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C} = \frac{1}{2^{|V|/2}} \prod_{x \in AB} \big(1 + K_x\big) \prod_{x \in A_\circ} (1 + K_x\big) \prod_{x \in B_\circ} (1 + K_x\big) \ket{0}^{|A|} \ket{0}^{|B|}.$$</div>
<p>
Noting that the last two products&nbsp;give
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C_{A_\circ}} = \frac{1}{2^{|A_\circ|/2}} \prod_{x \in A} (1 + K_x\big) \ket{0}^{|A|},\quad \ket{C_{B_\circ}} = \frac{1}{2^{|B_\circ|/2}} \prod_{x \in B_\circ} (1 + K_x\big) \ket{0}^{|B|} $$</div>
<p>
the cluster states of the subgraphs <span class="math">\(A_\circ\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B_\circ\)</span> we&nbsp;get
</p>
<div class="math">$$\ket{C} = \frac{1}{2^{|AB|/2}} \prod_{x \in \partial A} (1 + K_x\big) \ket{C_A} \ket{C_B},$$</div>
<p>
note the change in the normalization factor: this last product has <span class="math">\(|AB|\)</span> terms, corresponding to the set of <span class="math">\(K_x\)</span> operators with support over nodes adjacent to the interface of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: the number of edges cut by the interface. Note also that <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span> belongs to <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}(G)= \mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ket{C_{A_\circ}} \in \mathcal{H}_A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ket{C_{B_\circ}} \in \mathcal{H}_B\)</span> are cluster states of open boundary graphs. This last expression is in fact the schmidt decomposition of the cluster state <strong style="color:DarkSlateBlue; background-color:LightGray;"><span class="caps">EX</span></strong>:
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\label{e:sch}
\ket{C} = \frac{1}{2^{|AB|/2}} \sum_{K \in \mathcal{S}_{AB}} K \ket{C_A} \ket{C_B} = \frac{1}{2^{|AB|/2}} \sum_{b_A,b_B} \ket{b_A} \ket{b_B},
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(\ket{b_A}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ket{b_B}\)</span> are basis vectors of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}_A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>, respectively. Their are constructed from the <span class="math">\(K\)</span> operators by separating them into a product of pauli matrices in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: <span class="math">\(K = \sigma_A^{b_A} \sigma_B^{b_B}\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(|A|&lt;|B|\)</span> and the rank of the schmidt decomposition is <span class="math">\(|AB| = L\)</span> where <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is the number of nodes in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> with links on <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, namely the boundary <span class="math">\(L = |\partial A|\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an immediate consequence of <span class="math">\(\eqref{e:sch}\)</span> we obtain the reduced density matrix of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>
</p>
<div class="math">$$\rho_A = \frac{1}{2^{L}} 1_L, \; |AB| = |\partial A| = L,$$</div>
<p>
and thus, the entanglement&nbsp;entropy
</p>
<div class="math">$$S_A = L.$$</div>
<p>
This is precisely what the <em>entanglement area law</em> states for the cluster ground state <span class="math">\(\ket{C}\)</span> of the graph hamiltonian system <span class="math">\(H_C(G)\)</span>.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Demonstrate that the density matrix associated to the cluster state can be written as a superposition of the stabilizers <span class="math">\(K = \sigma^b\)</span> (in the notation we introduced&nbsp;above)
</p>
<div class="math">$$\rho = \ket{C}\bra{C} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|} \sum_{K \in \mathcal{S}} K, \quad |\mathcal{S}| = 2^{|V|}$$</div>
<p>
Using this expression show that the reduced density matrix of the subgraph <span class="math">\(A\)</span>&nbsp;is
</p>
<div class="math">$$\rho_A = \frac{1}{2^{|A|}} \sum_{K \in \mathcal{S}_A} K, \quad \mathcal{S}_A = \{K \in \mathcal{S} \mid \mathrm{supp}(K) \subseteq A \}.$$</div>
<p>
Explain why <span class="math">\(2^{|A|} \ne |\mathcal{S}_A|\)</span> in general, and compute the square of <span class="math">\(\rho_A\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\rho_A^2 = \frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}} \rho_A.$$</div>
<p>
Deduce from this result the entanglement&nbsp;entropy:
</p>
<div class="math">$$S_A = -\log\frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}},$$</div>
<p>
compare with the result in the main&nbsp;text.</p>
